#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It plays a vital role in technology by enabling the creation of software applications and systems thta power various aspects of modern life, including communication, entertainment and healthcare. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.1 The advent of structured programming in the 1970s laid the foundation for modern programming practices and influenced the development of subsequent programming paradigms such as object-oriented programming and functional programming. It played a crucial role in improving software quality and reliability.
2. The development of programming languages has been driven by the need for more efficient, readable, and maintainable code, as well as the evolving requirements of the computing industry. Each generation of languages has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors, leading to the diverse and powerful array of programming languages we have today.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s marked a transformative shift in software development practices. Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the limitations and frustrations associated with traditional, rigid project management approaches, such as the Waterfall model.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements: this involves collecting users needs and software requirements
2. Design: this involves creating a high-quality and detailed design for software architecture and user interface. 
3. Implementation: this involves writing your code and building your software. 
4. Testing: this involves conducting various tests to ensure thta it meaets the quality standards and functionality requirements. 
5.  Deployments: it is the phase where the software is made available for users. 
6. Maintenance: this is the last phase thta involves providing support,  updates, and enhancement to the software. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequencial approach, while agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach. In waterfall, each phase( Requirements,  design and implementation) needs to be completed before moving to the other phase. Adile methodology breaks down a project into smaller parts and adjust to changing requirements. In Waterfall , the requirements are gathered at the start of a project and remain unchanged throughout the course of the project. Waterfall uses a lot of documentations  while agile relies mostly on face-face communication which supports collaboration between the software development teams. 
scenarios: Wterfall can be used in construction projects and manufacturing because the environment is stable and changes are unlikely to occur.  Agile can be used in software development and tech projects, because this is where customer feedback is crucial. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software developer writes codes, maintains it and also improves the software applications. The responsibilities includes software design and development, requirement analysis from stakeholders to understand the project, system integration, testing and debugging softwares to ensure that they function well and are of high-quality standardds. 
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensure the quality and reliability of software products. Thet are responsible for test execution  to identify defects in the software, continuous omprovements which gives opportinities for improving testing processes and tools and are also responsible for user acceptance testing toensure that the final product meets the requiremtnts and expactations. 
A project manager oversees the planning, execution and successful delivery of software products. They are responsible for planning the project by identifying the timelines and resources needed for the estimated budget, they are responsible for leading the team, they monitor and control the progress of the projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Envirinment are important tools thta streamline the development process, improve code quality and enhance collaboration among developers.  They provide a comprehensive environment thta supports all aspects of software development, making them a vital component of any developer's toolkit. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code ,  IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and pyCharm. 
Version Control Systems are important tools thta enhance collaboration, improve code management, and ensures the reliability and integrity of software projects. Examples are Git, subversion and mercurial. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with evolving technology the tech industry is constantly evolving with new programming languages, frameworks and tool. Most programmers are failing to stay up to date with the changes. This challange can be overcomed by continuous learning and peer learning. 
Balancing quality and speed is one of the challanges faced by software engineers. The pressure to deliver the software on time can compromise the quality.  This can be overcomed by agile practices and tesr-driven development  which write tests before writing the actual code to endure it meets the required specs. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing tests individual units of a software, examples include JUnit(Java), NUnit(.NET), pytest(Python), Jasmine(Javascript).
Integration testing tests the interaction between different components. Examples include TestNG(Java),  Mocha(Javascript).
System testing tets the functionality of a software against he requirements and asses the performance scalability and reliability of the software. 
Acceptence Testing ensures that the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery.  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or ststements to get the best possible response from AI models.  It is like giving super clear instructions to a robot so it can do exactky what you want. It is important because it shapes how AI systems work and understand then respond to your quiries.  It teaches us how to dertermine what our golas are, perform tests, consider using machine learning methods, separste our instructions, to be specific or descriptive and how to use examples to get the best possible answer from AI. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt: "Describe a picture"
Improved prompt: "Describe a picture of a sunset over the ocean with seagulls flying."
Explanation: An improved prompt is more effective because it gives clear and precise instructions and contexts to get the best results from AI.
